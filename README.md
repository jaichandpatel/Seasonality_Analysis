**Time Series Analysis Code**
This repository contains R code for conducting time series analysis on chronic lifestyle diseases data. The analysis includes various tests, such as MAN-KENDALL and COX-STUART tests, calculation of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation, periodogram analysis, and seasonal decomposition using LOESS and TBATS methods.

**Instructions:**
Installation of Required Packages:

The following R packages need to be installed before running the code:
trend
TSA
forecast
Loading Required Libraries:

The code loads necessary libraries including trend, TSA, and forecast.
Importing Dataset:

The code prompts to select the dataset file (CSV format) which contains the time series data.
Handling Missing Values:

Missing values in the dataset are handled using the na.omit() function.
Conducting Tests:

MAN-KENDALL Test: Tests for trend detection in the data.
COX-STUART Test: Tests for the presence of cyclical patterns in the data.
Plotting Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation:

Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation plots are generated for each column in the dataset.
Calculating Periodicity:

Periodogram analysis is performed to identify the dominant frequencies and corresponding periods in the data.
Seasonal Decomposition:

Seasonal decomposition is conducted using both LOESS and TBATS methods to identify seasonal patterns in the data.
Usage:
Clone or download the repository.
Ensure R and RStudio are installed on your system.
Install required packages using install.packages().
Run the provided R script in RStudio.
Follow the instructions in the R script to select the dataset file.
Analyze the results generated by the code.
Note:
Make sure the dataset is in CSV format and follows the required structure.
Ensure the dataset does not contain any missing or erroneous values for accurate analysis.
