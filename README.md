**Time Series Analysis**
This repository contains R code for conducting time series analysis on chronic lifestyle diseases data. The analysis includes various tests, such as MAN-KENDALL and COX-STUART tests, calculation of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation, periodogram analysis, and seasonal decomposition using LOESS and TBATS methods.

**Instructions:**
Installation of Required Packages:

**The following R packages need to be installed before running the code:**
trend
TSA
forecast
**Loading Required Libraries:**

**The code loads necessary libraries including trend, TSA, and forecast.**
Importing Dataset:

**The code prompts to select the dataset file (CSV format) which contains the time series data.**
Handling Missing Values:

**Missing values in the dataset are handled using the na.omit() function.**
Conducting Tests:

**MAN-KENDALL Test**:
Tests for trend detection in the data.

**COX-STUART Test**:
Tests for the presence of cyclical patterns in the data.

**Plotting Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation:**
Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation plots are generated for each column in the dataset.

**Calculating Periodicity:**
Periodogram analysis is performed to identify the dominant frequencies and corresponding periods in the data.

**Seasonal Decomposition:**
Seasonal decomposition is conducted using both LOESS and TBATS methods to identify seasonal patterns in the data.

**Usage:**
Clone or download the repository.
Ensure R and RStudio are installed on your system.
Install required packages using install.packages().
Run the provided R script in RStudio.
Follow the instructions in the R script to select the dataset file.
Analyze the results generated by the code.

**Note:**
Make sure the dataset is in CSV format and follows the required structure.
Ensure the dataset does not contain any missing or erroneous values for accurate analysis.
